 * Turning a Graph rejection into something an agent can act on.

 * The Messenger and Instagram send APIs answer a policy refusal with "An
 * unknown error has occurred." and a code — no wording that names the rule, and
 * nothing an agent reading their timeline can do anything with. The code,
 * subcode and trace id are the only things that identify the refusal, and until
 * now they were dropped on the floor: the message row kept Meta's sentence and
 * nothing else, so a failure could only be diagnosed by guessing.
 *
 * This does what `lib/whatsapp/errors` does for that channel — keeps Meta's own
 * text, adds the explanation when the text would mislead, and always records
 * the numbers underneath it.
