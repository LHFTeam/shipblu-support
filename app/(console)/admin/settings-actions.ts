/**
 * Everything the admin screens write.

 * Split from `./actions` — which handles agents, channels and the importer —
 * because this file is the configuration that phase 3 made the product depend
 * on: SLA policies, automation rules, business hours, statuses, fields and
 * canned responses. All of it existed as tables with no way to edit them.
 *
 * Two rules run through every action here. Conditions and actions are validated
 * with the same parsers the engines use, so a rule that saves is a rule that
 * will run — the alternative is an admin form that accepts something the sweep
 * then silently ignores. And anything a ticket points at is deactivated rather
 * than deleted when it is in use, because deleting it would either orphan the
 * ticket or take it with it.

/**
 * When the console decides somebody has stopped working.

 * Under `admin.agents` rather than a permission of its own: it is a rule about
 * the team, and it sits on the page that lists them.
 *
 * Blank means the timer is off, and that is the only way to turn one off — so
 * an unreadable value has to be an error rather than a silent null, which is
 * what `optionalMinutes` above would give. A typo quietly disabling the
 * sign-out is exactly the failure this form must not have: nothing would look
 * wrong afterwards, because "nobody was ever signed out" and "the timeout is
 * working" look identical from the outside.
 *
 * Everything else about the numbers — whole, in range, and the sign-out no
 * shorter than the away — is `validatePolicy`'s, so the form and the tests
 * agree on the wording of each refusal.
